# daily-planner

## Description

- I created this project as part of my 5th challenge for coding bootcamp. For the project I started with an index HTMl, and a style.css sheet and needed to refractor to create a working daily planner. 

- In order to refractor the code I created all of the javascript and jquery. 

- The project contains a working daily planner with 8 sections where you can input your tasks as they correspond to the hours of the day. If a certain hour is in the past that section will display as gray. Present hours will display as red and hours in the future will display as green. When you save a task a message will pop up letting you know the task was saved.

- At first I created a mass of code with javascript. After working with my tutor I was able to simplify the code with jquery. Definitely need to continue to work with jquery as it made things so much easier than working with vanilla javascript.
