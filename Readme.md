# daily-planner

## Description
-I created this project as part of my 5th challenge for coding bootcamp. For the project I started with an index HTMl, and a style.css sheet and needed to refractor to create a working daily planner. 

-In order to refractor the code I created all of the javascript and jquery. 

-The project contains a working daily planner with 8 sections where you can input your tasks as they correspond to the hours of the day. If a certain hour is in the past that section will display as gray. Present hours will display as red and hours in the future will display as green. When you save a task a message will pop up letting you know the task was saved.

-I feel like I created a lot of code. The code functions properly and the page works but I feel like I could've simplified things with a couple properly working functions. I tried to work through my original javascript to simplify things but just submitted what worked in the end.
